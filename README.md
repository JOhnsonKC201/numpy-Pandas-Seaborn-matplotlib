#JohnsonKC_learning_Data_visulation

This is a short data analysis project I did for class. I used Python to look at 3 datasets

1. The Iris dataset (flower measurements)
2. A Wine Quality dataset (wine chemistry and taste score)

The goal was:
- Clean / inspect the data
- Make new features (like petal_ratio = petal_length / petal_width)
- Compare groups
- Visualize patterns

Basically: can we “see” differences in the data using plots.

## What I did
- Calculated summary stats (mean, median, std) by group
  - For Iris, group = species of flower
  - For Wine, group = quality score
- Built boxplots to compare groups
- Made scatter plots to check correlation between two measurements
- Looked at whether one variable goes up when another one goes up

## Tools I used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn

## How to run it
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `JohnsonKC_learning_Data_visulation.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter
3. Run all cells top to bottom
